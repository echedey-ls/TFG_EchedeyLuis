  abstractnote = {Abstract The global energy system has to be transformed towards high levels of sustainability in order to comply with the COP21 agreement. Solar photovoltaic (PV) offers excellent characteristics to play a major role in this energy transition. The key objective of this work is to investigate the role of PV in the global energy transition based on respective scenarios and a newly introduced energy transition model developed by the authors. A progressive group of energy transition scenarios present results of a fast growth of installed PV capacities and a high energy supply share of solar energy to the total primary energy demand in the world in the decades to come. These progressive energy transition scenarios can be confirmed. For the very first time, a full hourly modelling for an entire year is performed for the world, subdivided in 145 sub-regions, which is required to reflect the intermittent character of the future energy system. The model derives total installed solar PV capacity requirements of 7.1?9.1 TWp for the electricity sector (as of the year 2015) and 27.4 TWp for the entire energy system in the mid-term. The long-term capacity is expected to be 42 TWp and, because of the ongoing cost reduction of PV and battery technologies, this value is found to be the lower limit for the installed capacities. Solar PV electricity is expected to be the largest, least cost and most relevant source of energy in the mid-term to long-term for the global energy supply. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstractnote = {This report documents the various photovoltaic (PV) performance models and software developed and utilized by researchers at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in support of the Photovoltaics and Grid Integration Department. In addition to PV performance models, hybrid system and battery storage models are discussed. A hybrid system using other distributed sources and energy storage can help reduce the variability inherent in PV generation, and due to the complexity of combining multiple generation sources and system loads, these models are invaluable for system design and optimization. Energy storage plays an important role in reducing PV intermittency and battery storage models are used to understand the best configurations and technologies to store PV generated electricity. Other researcher's models used by SNL are discussed including some widely known models that incorporate algorithms developed at SNL. There are other models included in the discussion that are not used by or were not adopted from SNL research but may provide some benefit to researchers working on PV array performance, hybrid system models and energy storage. The paper is organized into three sections to describe the different software models as applied to photovoltaic performance, hybrid systems, and battery storage. For each model, there is a description which includes where to find the model, whether it is currently maintained and any references that may be available. Modeling improvements underway at SNL include quantifying the uncertainty of individual system components, the overall uncertainty in modeled vs. measured results and modeling large PV systems. SNL is also conducting research into the overall reliability of PV systems.},

PV technologies have grown into a substantial field of research and development through large stocks of scientific publications and patents. Besides cell technologies, the balance of system (BoS) components such as panels, electronics and energy storage form an important research area. The present article studies the development of the PV technological system using patent indicators. It is composed of three parts: First, it defines the system by thoroughly reviewing the various cell and BoS technologies. Second, it introduces a novel methodical approach for identifying its relevant patents. In that sense, the paper contributes with an accurate inventory of international patent classes for PV system. Finally, the geographical, organizational and technical trends over the past six decades are analysed along with a review of the most influential inventions. The analysis shows that 95% of the PV patent applications were filed by inventors from seven countries: Japan, Korea, China, USA, Germany, Taiwan, and France. Most patents were filed by companies and related to thin-film and crystalline-silicon cells as well as panel encapsulation and supporting structures. The analysis reviews the quantity, quality and technological specialization within countries’ patent profiles. It further provides an overview of the technological landscape and freedom-spaces available for manufacturers.},

The efficiency is also calculated for the case in which radiative recombination is only a fixed fraction fc of the total recombination, the rest being nonradiative. Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30% for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1.

However, most existing correction methods exhibit both climate and site dependencies.

Thus, the equations proposed here involve the three parameters that mostly influence the spectrum shape: air mass (AM), aerosol optical depth, and precipitable water. The extraction of the equations and their coefficients is then presented. Next, the method is empirically validated over the course of a 12-mo experimental campaign. Thus, coefficients of determination ranging from 0.87 (multicrystalline silicon) to 0.92 (amorphous silicon) prove that modeled values of the spectral mismatch factor (MM) are well aligned with experimental ones. In addition to the values of mean bias error that are virtually equal to zero, this new procedure also yields values of root mean square error that stay below 0.85% when modeling MM for all the technologies under investigation. Such figures are far better than those achieved by using the popular Sandia Labs method, based solely on AM.},

  abstractnote = {In modeling canopy photosynthesis, it is important to discriminate between the direct and diffuse components of incoming, global radiation. An equation is presented to estimate the share of both components from the measured daily global irradiance only. In this equation the share of the diffuse component is related to the ratio between global and extra-terrestrial radiation. This relation is based on a summary of literature data and of radiation measurements in The Netherlands. The diurnal trends of global, direct and diffuse radiation were derived from a sinusoid with a correction depending on solar angle. The random variation around this sine wave is characterized. For clear skies about 15% of the diffuse flux comes predominantly from directions near the sun and this circumsolar component has to be added to the direct flux. On the other hand, for clear skies the diffuse fraction in the photosynthetically active wave bands is about 40% larger than that for the total global radiation. In the past, the partitioning between direct and diffuse radiation was tackled by assuming that short periods of either fully clear or overcast conditions alternate within the day. That approach severely underestimated the share of the diffuse component in the total global radiation. The method presented in this paper is particularly useful for application in crop growth models.},

  abstractnote = {In a preceding paper, a method was presented to estimate the diurnal courses of total, direct and diffuse radiation from total daily radiation only. In the present paper, these relations are introduced into a simulation model for daily canopy assimilation. With the assimilation—light response of single leaves, assimilation rates of sunlit and shaded leaf area are calculated in relation to vertical position within the canopy and time of day. Numerical integration over canopy layers and over the day yields the daily canopy assimilation. Neglecting variation in illumination intensity of the leaves overestimates assimilation due to the convex, asymptotic assimilation—light response. For an atmospheric radiation transmission of 0.5 and a canopy with leaf area index of 5, daily canopy assimilation was overestimated by 2% when only the mean leaf angle was considered, 7% when all incoming light was treated as diffuse, 14% when light intensity was averaged over the day, and 23% when light absorption was averaged over canopy layers. These percentages increased sharply with an increase in atmospheric transmission. Neglecting the random variation in irradiance around the diurnal sine wave, overestimated assimilation by only 2–3%. Daily canopy assimilation was approximated very closely by using a weighted average of the assimilation rates at only three selected canopy depths at three times of day. A more concise model appeared to be satisfactory: a rectangular hyperbola for leaf assimilation—light response, integrated analytically over canopy leaf area index and using the irradiance averaged over the day.},

  abstractnote = {Decomposition models of solar irradiance estimate the magnitude of diffuse horizontal irradiance from global horizontal irradiance. These two radiation components are well known to be essential for predicting the performance of solar photovoltaic systems. In open-field agrivoltaic systems (i.e., the dual use of land for both agricultural activities and solar power conversion), cultivated crops receive unequal amounts of direct, diffuse, and reflected photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). These uneven amounts depend on where the crops are growing due to the non-homogenous shadings caused by the presence of the installed solar panels (above the crops or vertically mounted). It is known that, per unit of total PAR, diffuse PAR is more efficient for canopy photosynthesis than is direct PAR. For this reason, it is essential to estimate the diffuse PAR component when agrivoltaic systems are being assessed, in order to properly predict the crop yield. Since PAR is the electromagnetic radiation in the 400–700 nm waveband that can be used for photosynthesis by the crops, several stand-alone decomposition models typically used to split global horizontal irradiance are selected in this study to decompose PAR into direct and diffuse. These models are applied and validated in three locations in Sweden (Lanna, Hyltemossa and Norunda) using the coefficients stated on the models’ original publications and locally fitted coefficients. The results showed weaker performances in all stand-alone models for non-locally fitted coefficients (nRMSE ranging from 27% to 43%). However, performances improve with re-parameterization, with a highest nRMSE of 35.24% in Lanna. The Yang2 decomposition model is the best-performing one, with the lowest nRMSE of 23.75% in Norunda when applying re-estimated coefficients. Country level sets of coefficients for the best-performing models (Yang2 and Starke) are given after parameterization using combined data for all three locations in Sweden. These Sweden-fitted models are tested and show an nRMSE of 25.08% (Yang2) and 28.60% (Starke). These results can be used to perform estimations of the PAR diffuse component in Sweden wherever ground measurements are not available. The overall methodology can be similarly applied to other countries.},

We evaluated several scenarios including horizontal single-axis tracking (HSAT) over natural ground-cover and rooftop-mounted systems over high albedo reflective roofs. We found mismatch losses of up to 1.5% annual loss for very close-mounted (0.15 m) rooftop systems, but losses for HSAT systems and high-ground-clearance rooftop systems were lower (<0.5%). A simplified empirical relationship was found that links the spatial variation of irradiance (specifically, the mean absolute difference of irradiance) to the resulting mismatch loss factor, with an R2 better than .99. This approximate relationship was experimentally validated on mismatched PV modules, and it provides a basis for rapidly estimating bifacial mismatch loss factors for use in hourly PV performance simulations such as PVSyst or SAM. Additional parameters investigated include (a) climate dependence and module orientation, which were not found to have a strong impact on bifacial mismatch losses and (b) PV module fill factor and bifaciality ratio, which did have a strong linear impact on mismatch losses.},

However, a comprehensive understanding of the shading effects on crops is essential for choosing an optimal agrivoltaic system, as an incorrect choice can result in significant crop yield reductions. In this study, fixed vertical, one-axis tracking, and two-axis tracking photovoltaic arrays were developed for agrivoltaic applications to analyse the shading conditions on the ground used for crop production. The models demonstrated remarkable accuracy in comparison to commercial software such as PVsyst® and SketchUp®. These models will help to reduce crop yield uncertainty under agrivoltaic systems by providing accurate photosynthetically active radiation distribution at the crop level. The photosynthetically active radiation distribution was further analysed using a light homogeneity index, and the results showed that homogeneity and photosynthetically active radiation reduction varied significantly depending on the agrivoltaic system design, ranging from 86% to 95%, and 11% to 22%, respectively. Studying the effect of shading with distribution analysis is crucial for identifying the most suitable agrivoltaic system layout for specific crops and geographical locations.},

Few studies have taken into consideration the density of defects while looking into quality of software and proneness to defects. Analysis of this study has shown that defect density is relevant to different developers and different product sizes. Thus, open source project has shown to have low defect density and the larger the product the lower the defect density is. In addition, this study has shown that there are different metrics that correlate with each other indicating that some of these metrics have conceptual and practical relevance to each other.

I contend that the open source software phenomenon has metamorphosed into a more mainstream and commercially viable form, which I label as OSS 2.0. I illustrate this transformation using a framework of process and product factors, and discuss how the bazaar metaphor, which up to now has been associated with the open source development process, has actually shifted to become a metaphor better suited to the OSS 2.0 product delivery and support process. Overall the OSS 2.0 phenomenon is significantly different from its free software antecedent. Its emergence accentuates the fundamental alteration of the basic ground rules in the software landscape, signifying the end of the proprietary-driven model that has prevailed for the past 20 years or so. Thus, a clear understanding of the characteristics of the emergent OSS 2.0 phenomenon is required to address key challenges for research and practice.},

To illustrate this method, we present the design and implementation of Python Tutor (pythontutor.com), a code visualization tool that is, to our knowledge, one of the most widely-used pieces of research software developed within a university lab. Over the past decade, it has been used by over ten million people in over 180 countries. It has also contributed to 55 publications from 35 research groups in 13 countries. We distilled lessons from working on Python Tutor into three sets of design guidelines: 1) user experience design for scale and sustainability, 2) software architecture design for long-term sustainability, and 3) designing a sustainable software development workflow within academia. These guidelines can enable a student to create long-lasting software that reaches many users and facilitates research from many independent groups.},

One notable drawback is the Perez model’s reliance on empirical coefficients assigned to discrete bins of the sky clearness parameter, resulting in discontinuities in the calculated tilted irradiance. In this study, we present a novel method to eliminate the discontinuities of the Perez model by replacing the empirical look-up table with a set of six quadratic splines. This is facilitated by transforming the unbounded sky clearness parameter (epsilon) to an equivalent bounded parameter (zeta). Transposition using the original Perez model and continuous Perez–Driesse model are compared for multiple orientations at two locations. The two models produce very similar deviation statistics, meaning the continuous version can be used as a plug-in replacement for the original. Reverse transposition is demonstrated using the Perez–Driesse model together with a new continuous version of the Erbs diffuse fraction model and a simple bisection solution search. This combination achieves a substantially higher success rate than the GTI-DIRINT algorithm in our tests.},
