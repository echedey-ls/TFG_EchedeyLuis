  abstractnote = {This report documents the various photovoltaic (PV) performance models and software developed and utilized by researchers at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) in support of the Photovoltaics and Grid Integration Department. In addition to PV performance models, hybrid system and battery storage models are discussed. A hybrid system using other distributed sources and energy storage can help reduce the variability inherent in PV generation, and due to the complexity of combining multiple generation sources and system loads, these models are invaluable for system design and optimization. Energy storage plays an important role in reducing PV intermittency and battery storage models are used to understand the best configurations and technologies to store PV generated electricity. Other researcher's models used by SNL are discussed including some widely known models that incorporate algorithms developed at SNL. There are other models included in the discussion that are not used by or were not adopted from SNL research but may provide some benefit to researchers working on PV array performance, hybrid system models and energy storage. The paper is organized into three sections to describe the different software models as applied to photovoltaic performance, hybrid systems, and battery storage. For each model, there is a description which includes where to find the model, whether it is currently maintained and any references that may be available. Modeling improvements underway at SNL include quantifying the uncertainty of individual system components, the overall uncertainty in modeled vs. measured results and modeling large PV systems. SNL is also conducting research into the overall reliability of PV systems.},

  abstractnote = {Against the pressing challenges of climate change and fossil fuel depletion, renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaics (PV) are considered a clean and sustainable alternative. PV technologies have grown into a substantial field of research and development through large stocks of scientific publications and patents. Besides cell technologies, the balance of system (BoS) components such as panels, electronics and energy storage form an important research area. The present article studies the development of the PV technological system using patent indicators. It is composed of three parts: First, it defines the system by thoroughly reviewing the various cell and BoS technologies. Second, it introduces a novel methodical approach for identifying its relevant patents. In that sense, the paper contributes with an accurate inventory of international patent classes for PV system. Finally, the geographical, organizational and technical trends over the past six decades are analysed along with a review of the most influential inventions. The analysis shows that 95% of the PV patent applications were filed by inventors from seven countries: Japan, Korea, China, USA, Germany, Taiwan, and France. Most patents were filed by companies and related to thin-film and crystalline-silicon cells as well as panel encapsulation and supporting structures. The analysis reviews the quantity, quality and technological specialization within countries’ patent profiles. It further provides an overview of the technological landscape and freedom-spaces available for manufacturers.},

  abstractnote = {In order to find an upper theoretical limit for the efficiency of p‐n junction solar energy converters, a limiting efficiency, called the detailed balance limit of efficiency, has been calculated for an ideal case in which the only recombination mechanism of hole‐electron pairs is radiative as required by the principle of detailed balance. The efficiency is also calculated for the case in which radiative recombination is only a fixed fraction fc of the total recombination, the rest being nonradiative. Efficiencies at the matched loads have been calculated with band gap and fc as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with temperatures of 6000°K and 300°K, respectively. The maximum efficiency is found to be 30% for an energy gap of 1.1 ev and fc = 1. Actual junctions do not obey the predicted current‐voltage relationship, and reasons for the difference and its relevance to efficiency are discussed.},
